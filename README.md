<h3>Future Development</h3>
I intend to add levels based on either the seasons of the anime iteself, or by volume in the manga series. Possibly even giving the user the choice to choose to either play answering from the anime, or the manga series. Want to add a database connection and user authentication/login to keep track of scores and create a leader board. I also want to add small audio or video clips as trivia questions themselves, harder levels could contain questions pertaining to the creators and the development of characters and story.
